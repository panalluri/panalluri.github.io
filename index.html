            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University. My primary interest is in using machine learning to improve computational models of oceanographic systems. Currently, I am using machine learning to parametrize the effect of small-scale air-sea interactions on large-scale ocean dynamics. From my undergraduate years, I have over three years of research experience in Geophysical and Computational Fluid Dynamics. This work has resulted in three published papers. My research has also helped develop my technical skills. I am well-versed in C/C++, MATLAB, Julia, Python, Linux, PETSc, FEniCSx, SolidWorks, ParaView, VisIt, and Gmsh. </p>
