            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University. My primary interest is in using machine learning to improve computational models of oceanographic systems. Currently, I am using machine learning to parametrize the effect of small-scale air-sea interactions on large-scale ocean dynamics. From my undergraduate years, I have over three years of research experience in Geophysical and Computational Fluid Dynamics. This work has resulted in three published papers. My research has also helped develop my technical skills. I am well-versed in C/C++, MATLAB, Julia, Python, Linux, PETSc, FEniCSx, SolidWorks, ParaView, VisIt, and Gmsh. </p>

                <h3>Doctoral Research</h3>
                <p>My doctoral work has centered around developing neural network-based parameterizations for small-scale processes in the ocean.</p>

                        <h4>Parameterizing the impacts of heterogeneity at the air-sea interface</h4>
                        <p>This project aims to implement a machine learning-based parameterization in CESM that will capture sub-grid spatial heterogeneityâ€™s impact on heat and momentum exchange at the air-sea interface. This involves analyzing and filtering CESM datasets, computing multi-scale air-sea fluxes, and training a neural network-based parameterization.</p>

                        <h4>Parameterizing sub-mesoscale tracer transport</h4>
                        <p>Idealized modeling of sub-mesoscale tracer transport to develop machine learning based parametrizations and investigate novel data analysis methods. Working with Python based Quasi-Geostrophic model (PyQG), and adding new modules for solving coupled passive and reactive tracer advection-diffusion equations. Also incorporating such parametrizations into coupled idealized air-sea models.</p>

                        <h4>A methodology for porting CUTEst optimization problems to Julia</h4>
                        <p>Developed native Julia ports of test problems from CUTEst, a collection of test problems used to hone mathematical optimizers. CUTEst test problems are mostly only available in Julia via an interface that generates Fortran code from a problem description, then compiles and invokes that Fortran implementation. I developed a Julia module that supports capabilities that the older CUTEst infrastructure supports; added further functionalities, such as computing in arbitrary precision.</p>
