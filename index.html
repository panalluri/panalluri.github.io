            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am PhD student in the <a href="https://www.apam.columbia.edu/programs/applied-mathematics">Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>. My primary interest is in using machine learning to improve computational models of oceanographic systems. My research is conducted at <a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a> and <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/">LEAP</a> (Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics), a NSF STC focused on using machine learning to improve near-term cliamte predictions. I am also an affiliate with <a href="https://m2lines.github.io/">M2LInES</a> (Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling), an international project that uses machine learning to capture unaccounted physical processes at the air-sea-ice interface in order to improve climate projections. Currently, my work focuses on using neural networks to parametrize the effect of small-scale air-sea fluxes on large-scale atmosphere and ocean dynamics. </p>

                <h3>Doctoral Research</h3>
                <p>My doctoral work has centered around developing neural network-based parameterizations for small-scale processes in the ocean.</p>

                        <h4>Parameterizing the impacts of heterogeneity at the air-sea interface</h4>
                        <p><i>Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Advisor: Dhruv Balwada</i></p>
                        <p>This project aims to implement a machine learning-based parameterization in CESM that will capture sub-grid spatial heterogeneityâ€™s impact on heat and momentum exchange at the air-sea interface. This involves analyzing and filtering CESM datasets, computing multi-scale air-sea fluxes, and training a neural network-based parameterization.</p>

                        <h4>Parameterizing sub-mesoscale tracer transport</h4>
                        <p>Idealized modeling of sub-mesoscale tracer transport to develop machine learning based parametrizations and investigate novel data analysis methods. Working with Python based Quasi-Geostrophic model (PyQG), and adding new modules for solving coupled passive and reactive tracer advection-diffusion equations. Also incorporating such parametrizations into coupled idealized air-sea models.</p>

                <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
                <p>My undergraduate research centered around Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and mathematical physics, with a strong applied math foundation.</p>

                        <h4>How does snow age? Quantifying coarsening of dry snow microstructure through phase-field simulations</h4>
                        <p>Computationally modeled dry snow metamorphosis by developing codes for and utilizing nonlinear PDE solvers. Created MATLAB image analysis scripts to quantify snow particle geometry evolution. Developed scripts to analyze particle coarsening rate at various temperatures.</p>

                        <h4>A methodology for porting CUTEst optimization problems to Julia</h4>
                        <p>Developed native Julia ports of test problems from CUTEst, a collection of test problems used to hone mathematical optimizers. CUTEst test problems are mostly only available in Julia via an interface that generates Fortran code from a problem description, then compiles and invokes that Fortran implementation. I developed a Julia module that supports capabilities that the older CUTEst infrastructure supports; added further functionalities, such as computing in arbitrary precision.</p>
